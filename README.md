The find_params folder contains code used to run experiments to find the best Spiking Neural Network (SNN) parameters.

The novelty_modulated_oneshot folder contains code to run the one shot experiments with the backpropagation-based recollection hypothesis.

The svm_one_shot folder contains code to run the one shot experiments with the SVM baseline.
